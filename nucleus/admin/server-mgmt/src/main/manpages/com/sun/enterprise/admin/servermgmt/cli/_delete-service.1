_delete-service(1)        asadmin Utility Subcommands       _delete-service(1)

NAME
       _delete-service - delete init scripts created by create-script

SYNOPSIS
           _create-service [--help] [--name service-name]
           [--system-type system-type]
           [--nodedir node-dir] [--node node]
           [domain-or-instance-name]

DESCRIPTION
       The _delete-service subcommand delete init scripts created by
       the subcommand create-script.

       If no operand is specified and the domains directory contains only one
       domain, the subcommand deletes the script starting the DAS for the
       default domain. If no operand is specified and the domains directory
       contains multiple domains, an error occurs.

       The subcommand contains internal logic to determine whether the
       supplied operand is a DAS or an instance.

       This subcommand is supported in local mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --name
           (Windows and Oracle Solaris systems only) The name of the service
           that you will use when administering the service through Oracle
           Solaris SMF commands or the service management features of the
           Windows operating system. The default is the name of the domain or
           instance that is specified as the operand of this subcommand.

       --system-type system-type
           If specified, system-type must be one of systemd, systemv, solaris
           or windows, which determine the type of init scripts to create.
           If not specified, the command performs autodetection of init system.

       --nodedir
           Specifies the directory that contains the instance's node
           directory. The instance's files are stored in the instance's node
           directory. The default is as-install/nodes. If this option is
           specified, the operand must specify an instance.

       --node
           Specifies the node on which the instance resides. This option may
           be omitted only if the directory that the --nodedir option
           specifies contains only one node directory. Otherwise, this option
           is required. If this option is specified, the operand must specify
           an instance.

OPERANDS
       domain-or-instance-name
           The name of the domain or instance to configure. If no operand is
           specified, the default domain is used.

EXAMPLES
       Deleting a Service on a Linux System using SystemD init
           This example deletes a service for the default domain on a system
           that is running Linux and SystemD. It is necessary to inform
           SystemD about deleting the script by running systemctl daemon-reload.
