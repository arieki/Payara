/**
 * Startup level for deploying applications that have previously been deployed. This is for services that need to
 * startup after the typical set of dependent services have booted, after any required configuration has been done via
 * post-boot commands, after any resources and applications specified for deployment via post-boot commands have deployed,
 * but before autodeploying applications (e.g. applications in the autodeploy directory, or the admin console).
 * Most prominent use case for this startup level is for applications that have previously been deployed, and are thus
 * already registered in the domain.xml. We want this to happen after the post-boot phase so that the server and any
 * resource adaptors can be potentially reconfigured via post-boot commands before they are loaded.
